## 📋 Instructions
Search for an item and enter your guess, then view your guess to find correct and incorrect properties.

Repeat the process, narrowing down the possibilities until you find the right item!

Revealed properties appear in the item tooltip. After 10 guesses, a blurred legendary power will also appear, which you may hover over to reveal it.

A green background indicates a correct value, and a red background indicates an incorrect value.

### Item type

### 📚 Classes

All 7 classes are included, those being the base 5, *Barbarian*, *Demon Hunter*, *Monk*, *Witch Doctor* and *Wizard*, as well as the *Crusader* from *Reaper of Souls* and the *Necromancer* from the DLC *Rise of the Necromancer*.

Additionally *Generic* is included for items that are not class-specific, even if the item is intended for a specific class, e.g. *Wraps of Clarity* is treated as *Generic* despite its legendary power only working for *Demon Hunters*.

Meanwhile hand crossbows will be designated *Demon Hunter* as only that class can equip them. Class sets will be designated their class, even if the item slot may be *Generic*, due to class sets being inherently class-specific, e.g. *Shadow's Bane* is a *Chest Armor* but can only be equipped by *Demon Hunters*.
